        <h2>Purpose, goals, and audience</h2>
        <p>The purpose of the website is to show the public who the editorial staff of TheSign is, what they do, and their schedule. The goal is to reach out to a larger public, and in that way increase the number of readers of TheSign.</p>

        <h2>Page Layout and Appearance</h2>
        <p>We will be using the font Futura, in medium and bold. The size will vary depending on the text type. The largest headings will be in size 48, the smaller headings will be in 24, the description underneath some of the headings will be in size 14, the different words/elements in the navbar will be in size 20 and finally, the paragraphs will be in size 16.</p>
        <p>The color scheme for our website will be quite simple. We wish for the text to be in black, unless it is a heading, then they will be in different shades of grey. The background color will be white. When hovering over links they will become underlined. We will not be using borders, and will only be using a shadows on the navbar, which will be grey.</p>
        <p>The navbar will be positioned at the top. It will be simple, white, with a drop shadow that distinguishes it from the rest of the page. The navbar will contain three elements/words (Home, About us, Contact us) and all the way to the left, the logo of TheSign.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>There will be no background images.</p>
        <p>Our universal design decisions are quite simple and elegant for several reasons. Firstly, they increase the website's readability, and permit easy navigation, but most importantly, they are simple so as not to distract from the images and the content of the school paper, which naturally should be the main attraction of the website.</p>
