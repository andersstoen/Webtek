    <h2>Purpose and goals</h2>
    <p>The purpose of the website is to show the public who the editorial staff of TheSign is, what they do, and their schedule. This means presenting the editorial staff, showing off the different issues of the school paper and the process of making these, and lastly, informing them of the release date for the upcoming issues. Additionally, the public will have an easy way to get in contact with the editorial staff.
        The goal is to reach out to a larger public, and in that way increase the number of readers of TheSign.
    </p>
    <h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>The intended audience of the website will consist mainly of students and teachers at NTNU, especially those from the Institute of Design. The newspaper TheSign contains information that is largely directed at design students. However, the information may still be attractive to students from other affiliations, and are therefore included in the intended audience. Many students might not have been able to attend the official release of an issue, and might therefore be interested in checking it out online, and maybe downloading it from this website. Some users might even be interested in viewing some of the older editions.</p>

    <p>The intended audience will also consist of potentially new members of the editorial staff. Once a year the editorial staff of TheSign looks for new members. The website will be a good way of promoting the group and their work, and in this way maybe convince several students to apply for the available positions. </p>

    <p>The last part of the intended audience consists of potentially new sponsors.The magazine is constantly in need of new sponsors. With a website they may easily show potential sponsors what TheSign is and what they might agree to sponsor.</p>
